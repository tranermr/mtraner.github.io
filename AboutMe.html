							<h3>About Me</h3>
							<span class="image main"><img src="images/pic13.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							<p>Hello! I’m Mike Traner, a recent PhD graduate in Biomedical Engineering, with a fervent passion for learning new technologies and tools, and applying them to develop technical solutions to improve people’s lives.  Throughout my academic journey I applied my passion for device and process development to develop tools and support research leveraging cyborg sensors for chemical detection. </p>
							<p>	The driving intent behind my graduate research was to develop ways to record and process neural data from locusts to detect chemical compounds in the environment, especially signatures of hazards such as explosives. To that end I worked on the development of a wide-range of tools over multiple foundational projects, working both solo and as part of interdisciplinary teams.</p>
							<p>	There were two areas of development that I particularly focused on. The first was the development of tools and processes for surgically implanting neural recording electrodes to enable robust recording performance, both for applications such as explosives detection, and to enable more advanced studies of the neural algorithms used for processing olfactory cues. The second area was the design and development of automated behavior and neural recording rigs, including stimulus delivery, neural and behavioral data recording, and data cleaning and analysis pipelines. These were used for studying the strategies used to navigate environments via olfactory data, and evaluating the performance of implanted surgical electrodes. Some samples of these projects are displayed in my portfolio (link).</p>
							<p>	As I transition into industry I am eager to bring my expertise, creativity, and passion for engineering to new roles and applications. I am particularly interested in opportunities where I can contribute to developing solutions that enhance patient care, improve diagnostic and treatment processes, and improve access to quality care.</p>
							<p>	When not working on professional projects I enjoy tinkering on my own projects, working in my workshop, or performing DIY projects and maintenance on my home. Some of the personal projects I’ve pursued are also included in my portfolio. </p>
							<p>	If you’d like to get in touch with me or learn more about the projects I’ve worked on, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn(link) or look at my work on Github(link) or Google Scholar (link). Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and I look forward to exploring opportunities for collaboration on future endeavors!</p>
